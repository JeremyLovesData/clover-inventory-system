## Introduction

The Clover Inventory System is a tool designed to simplify and streamline inventory management for businesses that use the Clover Point of Sale (POS) system. This program assists users in updating their inventory records by importing data from Excel files. Whether you need to update existing items or add new ones, this system provides a user-friendly interface for managing your inventory efficiently.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using the Clover Inventory System, ensure you have the following:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (version 3.6 or higher) installed on your computer.
- The necessary Python packages, which can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas openpyxl barcode pillow fpdf
```

## Installation

To get started with the Clover Inventory System, follow these steps:

1. Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JeremyLovesData/clover-inventory-system.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd clover-inventory-system
```
3. Run the program:
```bash
python clover_inventory_system.py
```
## Usage

The Clover Inventory System provides two main functions for managing your inventory: updating existing items and adding new items.

### Updating Existing Items

If the item is already in the inventory:

1. Use the "Inventory Search" option to search for the item by name.
2. If the item is found, select the correct item, which will autopopulate the next screen.
3. Update the inventory with new stock (as items get sold in the POS, the quantity will get updated that way as well).
4. You can change the price and cost if needed.
5. The Excel document will be updated on that specific row with the new information.

### Adding New Items

If the item is a brand new item:

1. Use the "Update Inventory" selection and create a new barcode for it (12-digit UPCA).
2. Add in the name, quantity, price, and cost.
3. Click Submit, and it will autopopulate the Excel document with the new item at the very bottom.
4. This will also create both an image of the barcode as well as a .pdf of the barcode along with the product name and price that can be printed out on a label maker.

## File Naming Convention

The new Excel file generated by the Clover Inventory System is named with the day's date. This convention makes it easy to find and work with the file in the future.

## Integration with Clover POS

After updating your inventory in the Excel file using the Clover Inventory System, you can import the newly updated file into Clover POS via the dashboard. This action will automatically update the inventory system within Clover.
